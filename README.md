# Tattoo Booking System (AI-Powered) 🎨🤖

An end-to-end tattoo booking and scheduling system powered by AI. This project integrates image recognition using YOLOv8, tattoo style classification with PyTorch, session duration & pricing estimation, and Google Calendar syncing — all wrapped in a FastAPI web backend.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Tattoo Complexity Detection** (YOLOv8)
- **Tattoo Style Classification** (PyTorch-based CNN)
- **Session Duration & Pricing Estimator**
- **AI Chatbot** for User Queries
- **Admin & Customer Dashboards** (HTML + JS)
- **Google Calendar Integration**
- **Modular FastAPI Backend**
- Model training notebooks and scripts included

## 🧪 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VibhavJaiswal/tattoo-booking-system.git
cd tattoo-booking-system
```

### 2. Setup virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\\Scripts\\activate     # On Windows
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/Mac
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Add `.env` file

Create a `.env` file (you can start with `.env.example`) and add your API keys, model paths, and calendar credentials.

---

## 🤖 Model Files

Large model files are **not included** in the repo.

Please download the following and place them in the correct folders:
- `best.pt` (YOLOv8 weights)
- `tattoo_classifier.pth` (PyTorch classifier model)

👉 Store them in `/models/` and update the `.env` paths.

---

## 🧠 How it works

- Upload an image
- YOLO detects tattoo complexity
- PyTorch classifies the style
- Pricing + session time estimated
- User can book appointment → auto-added to Google Calendar
